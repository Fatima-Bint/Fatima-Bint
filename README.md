I am currently a software/network engineer, focused on Javascript, database management, and CSS. I'm also a pythonista 🐍 specifically for data science and AI. While my technical journey is still evolving, I'm deeply committed to contributing to the community, particularly Pyladies Ghana and Open-source projects.💻
