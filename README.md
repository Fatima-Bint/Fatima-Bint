I am currently a software engineering fellow, focused on Javascript, database management, and CSS. I'm also a pythonista 🐍 specifically for data science. While my technical journey is ever-evolving, I'm deeply committed to contributing to the community, particularly Pyladies Ghana and Open-source projects.💻
